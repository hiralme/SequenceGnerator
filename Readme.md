# Coding Test (Sequences) for World Nomad Group
This project contains an MVC UI using bootstrap

There should not be any special settings required to run this project on your local machine apart from getting the packages from NuGet.

I've created a solution that uses:

* MVC
* Unity for the IoC
* MSTest for the unit tests
* Bootstrap for the markup framework

The Unity.config file of the web project has the definitions for the sequence calculators that will be injected.

Sequence will be started from 0 as it's not clear in requirement that from where to start.
